https://gromacs.org-gmx-users.maillist.sys.kth.narkive.com/MNJzkHqi/gmx-users-flexible-water-vs-rigid-water - Erik Lindahl, 
a lead GROMACS developer, states: "It is almost impossible to minimize energy efficiently with fixed waters."

https://www.researchgate.net/post/Water-molecule-starting-at-atom-69515-can-not-be-settled-Does-anyone-have-an-idea-of-this-in-GROMACS -
Example of SETTLES issues that may occur when attempting to run a rigid-water energy minimization.

https://manual.gromacs.org/current/reference-manual/algorithms/energy-minimization.html - not relevant to our protocol, but note that conjugate
gradient energy minimization in GROMACS can ONLY be done using flexible water.

https://manual.gromacs.org/2018-current/user-guide/system-preparation.html - GROMACS documentation states: "You should consider using flexible
water models and not using bond constraints or frozen groups." when describing energy minimization.
