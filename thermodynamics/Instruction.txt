1. Prepare the *traj_solute* *traj_solvent* and *traj_complex* files.
   You need to make sure the following three varialbes in *driver.sh*
        TRAJ_DIR="../../../02_BE-2D-MetaD"
        TPR="../../../02_BE-2D-MetaD/prod01/start0.tpr"
        GRO="../../../02_BE-2D-MetaD/prod01/prod16.gro"
   are pointing to the correct files.

   The *driver.sh* generates the xtc files for each trajectory.
   The *driver2.sh* file combines multiple productions into a single trajectory.


2. Prepare the tops and mdps for the rerun. All these files should be put under the
   *tops* directory. The files names should be the same as in this example. 
   Specifically, you only need to prepare the *.top files. The *.mdp should not be
   touched.


3. Prepare the *assignment_rep1[2-6].txt* in the *assignments* directory for each
   replicas. Name the files as in the folder.


4. Do the rerun for energy calculation in *rerun*. 
   a). Modify the IC and NC values in *include.sh*. These are the cluster IDs for the 
       top 5 clusters: IC---NC. NC is the most populated one.
   b). bash driver_DoRerun.sh to calculate energies
   c). bash driver_FetchTrajEnergies.sh extracts energies from the edr files
   d). bash driver_CalcClusterEnergies.sh to calcualte the energies for each cluster.
   e). bash driver_CalcClusterEnthalpy.sh  to calculate the enthalpies 

5. Prepare the trajectories for each cluster in *traj_cluster*.
   The IC and NC values are read from *../rerun/include.sh*. So you do not need to
   modify anything to run the script.

5. Calculate the Entropy in each cluster in *entropy*
   Make sure put the following lines into your ~/.bash_profile
      export PARENTDIR=/cluster/tufts/ylin12/HONGTAO/local/PARENT-master
  and 
      bash driver.sh will submit the jobs to the cluster

  After the calculation done, *bash Sh_CalcEntropyMIST.sh* to fetch the MIST entropy values
  from the calculation. The IC and NC informaitons are read from ../rerun/include.sh
  No modification is need to any of these files.

6. Make the Thermodynamics talbes in *thermodynamics*
   Remember to modify the IC and NC values in *Py_GenTable.py*. Then,
   bash driver.sh 
   will do everything for you!
